*Task Description: Decision Tree Implementation**

The objective of this task is to implement a **Decision Tree algorithm** using the **scikit-learn** library in Python to perform a **classification task**. A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning technique that represents decisions and their possible outcomes in a tree-like structure, making it easy to understand and interpret.

In this implementation, a standard dataset (such as the Iris dataset) is used, which contains multiple input features and corresponding class labels. The task begins by loading the dataset and separating it into **features (input variables)** and **target labels (output classes)**. The data is then divided into **training and testing sets** to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.

A **DecisionTreeClassifier** is created by selecting an appropriate splitting criterion such as Gini Index or Entropy. The model is trained using the training dataset, where it learns decision rules by recursively splitting the data based on feature values that best separate the classes.

After training, the model is used to **predict class labels** for the test dataset. The predictions are compared with the actual labels to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. The **accuracy score** is calculated to measure how well the Decision Tree classifier performs.

This task demonstrates the complete workflow of a Decision Tree algorithm, including data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation. It highlights how Decision Trees can be effectively applied to classification problems and how scikit-learn simplifies machine learning implementation in Python.
